This project uses a publicly available dataset of National Science Foundation (NSF) award abstracts. The dataset contains award titles, abstracts, program elements, and other metadata used to power the hybrid retrieval system.

The original full dataset is available on Kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xiyaocheng/nsf-awards-dataset?select=nsf_dataset.csv

Because the raw file is very large (~300MB), it cannot be hosted directly in this GitHub repository. Instead, the dataset was cleaned, categorized, and downsampled for this project.


The cleaned dataset used in this project is:nsf_grants_clean.csv

GitHub does not allow uploading files over 100 MB, so the dataset is hosted on Google Drive.
